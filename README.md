## 📌 Project Overview

This project is an interactive web experience designed to showcase advanced front-end development skills. It goes beyond static layouts by allowing users to personalize their viewing experience, which is then remembered by the browser.

**The purpose of this project:**
- Implement **Dynamic Carousel logic** with responsive breakpoints.
- Master **Data Persistence** using Browser LocalStorage.
- Create a **Theme Switcher** (Dark/Light mode) using Tailwind CSS.
- Build a **Font Customizer** to switch between multiple Arabic/English fonts (Alexandria, Tajawal, Cairo).
- Practice **Clean Code** and DOM manipulation.

---

## 🔧 How It Works (JavaScript Logic)

- **Responsive Carousel:** The slider calculates the number of visible cards based on the window width (`window.innerWidth`) and adjusts its behavior for Mobile, Tablet, and Desktop.
- **Persistence Layer:** Every user preference (Theme choice, Selected Font) is saved in `localStorage`. When the page reloads, a script instantly retrieves and applies these settings.
- **Dynamic Styling:** Used `classList` and `setAttribute` to manipulate the DOM and apply Tailwind utility classes on the fly.

---

## 🎨 Features

- 🎠 **Smart Carousel:** Smooth sliding testimonials with auto-adjusting steps.
- 🌓 **Dark/Light Mode:** Full theme toggle that saves user preference.
- 🔡 **Font Switcher:** Ability to switch between 3 professional fonts with a "Active" state indicator.
- 💾 **State Persistence:** Your settings (Theme & Font) stay the same even after closing the browser.
- 📱 **Mobile First:** Fully optimized for all screen sizes using Tailwind's responsive modifiers.
- 🔄 **Reset System:** A dedicated button to clear all preferences and restore default settings.
